/// SIP Transaction State
///
/// `TransactionState` represents the various states a SIP transaction can be in
/// during its lifecycle. These states implement the transaction state machines
/// defined in RFC 3261 for both client and server transactions.
///
/// # States
///
/// * `Nothing` - Initial state for client transactions created
/// * `Calling` - Initial state for client transactions when request is sent or received
/// * `Trying` - Request has been sent/received, waiting for response/processing
/// * `Proceeding` - Provisional response received/sent (1xx except 100 Trying)
/// * `Completed` - Final response received/sent, waiting for ACK (INVITE) or cleanup
/// * `Confirmed` - ACK received/sent for INVITE transactions
/// * `Terminated` - Transaction has completed and is being cleaned up
///
/// # State Transitions
///
/// ## Client Non-INVITE Transaction
/// ```text
/// Nothing → Calling → Trying → Proceeding → Completed → Terminated
/// ```
///
/// ## Client INVITE Transaction  
/// ```text
/// Nothing → Calling → Trying → Proceeding → Completed → Terminated
///                                      ↓

/// SIP Transaction Type
///
/// `TransactionType` distinguishes between the four types of SIP transactions
/// as defined in RFC 3261. Each type has different behavior for retransmissions,
/// timers, and state transitions.
///
/// # Types
///
/// * `ClientInvite` - Client-side INVITE transaction (UAC INVITE)
/// * `ClientNonInvite` - Client-side non-INVITE transaction (UAC non-INVITE)
/// * `ServerInvite` - Server-side INVITE transaction (UAS INVITE)
/// * `ServerNonInvite` - Server-side non-INVITE transaction (UAS non-INVITE)
///
/// # Characteristics
///
/// ## Client INVITE
/// * Longer timeouts due to human interaction
/// * ACK handling for 2xx responses
/// * CANCEL support for early termination
///
/// ## Client Non-INVITE
/// * Shorter timeouts for automated responses
/// * No ACK required
/// * Simpler state machine
///
/// ## Server INVITE
/// * Must handle ACK for final responses
/// * Supports provisional responses
/// * Complex retransmission rules
///
/// ## Server Non-INVITE
/// * Simple request/response pattern
/// * No ACK handling
/// * Faster completion
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use rsipstack::transaction::TransactionType;
/// use rsip::Method;
///
/// fn get_transaction_type(method: &Method, is_client: bool) -> TransactionType {
///     match (method, is_client) {
///         (Method::Invite, true) => TransactionType::ClientInvite,
///         (Method::Invite, false) => TransactionType::ServerInvite,
///         (_, true) => TransactionType::ClientNonInvite,

/// SIP Transaction Timers
///
/// `TransactionTimer` represents the various timers used in SIP transactions
/// as defined in RFC 3261. These timers ensure reliable message delivery
/// and proper transaction cleanup.
///
/// # Timer Types
///
/// * `TimerA` - Retransmission timer for client transactions (unreliable transport)
/// * `TimerB` - Transaction timeout timer for client transactions
/// * `TimerD` - Wait timer for response retransmissions (client)
/// * `TimerE` - Retransmission timer for non-INVITE server transactions
/// * `TimerF` - Transaction timeout timer for non-INVITE server transactions
/// * `TimerK` - Wait timer for ACK (server INVITE transactions)
/// * `TimerG` - Retransmission timer for INVITE server transactions
/// * `TimerCleanup` - Internal cleanup timer for transaction removal
///
/// # Timer Values (RFC 3261)
///
/// * T1 = 500ms (RTT estimate)
/// * T2 = 4s (maximum retransmit interval)
/// * T4 = 5s (maximum duration a message will remain in the network)
///
/// ## Timer Calculations
/// * Timer A: starts at T1, doubles each retransmission up to T2
/// * Timer B: 64*T1 (32 seconds)
/// * Timer D: 32 seconds for unreliable, 0 for reliable transports
/// * Timer E: starts at T1, doubles up to T2
/// * Timer F: 64*T1 (32 seconds)
/// * Timer G: starts at T1, doubles up to T2
/// * Timer K: T4 for unreliable, 0 for reliable transports
